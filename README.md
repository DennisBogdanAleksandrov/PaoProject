# PaoProject

...Not much to say except one of the coolest projects out there! I'm creating a tool for the memory fanatics who know about the Pao system. It's like quizlet in how you review your set of cards but spacifically for the Pao system that allows displays 3 different sets side by side. Try to get quizlet to do that.
